# Architecture

Team8Paper is a rich web application crafted with Javascript and JQuery on the client side,
Scala on the server side, and MongoDB on the persistence side. In general terms, it has a client-server architecture
with client sending requests to the server by making HTTP calls. JSON, REST, and non-blocking are three attributes emphasized
in the design. Input and outputs are JSON when possible, routes follow REST for easy communication, and server and client handles
requests asynchronously so that the application exceeds at scaling.
